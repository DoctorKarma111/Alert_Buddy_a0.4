# üìù About

The Medtek Alert Buddy Smart Light Bar is designed for Medrunner members. 
It integrates with the Medrunner API to receive alerts and triggers pre-configured light and sound presets. 
This app manages the communication and configuration of the Alert buddy system.

## üöÄ Features

- **Event-driven Architecture**: Processes real-time emergencies from the Medrunner API.
- **Emergency Lights**: Enables triggering vibrant and dynamic lighting effects for notifications of incoming emergencies.
- **Sound Alerts**: Enables triggering sound files for notifications of incoming emergencies.
- **Clean and minimal design**: Offers a focused and minimal dashboard which allows distration free operation while maintaining having full control.
- **Ambient/Party Light**: Can also be used for mood lighting.
- **Connectivity Easy access**: Can be accessed from any browser on the same network.
- **Advanced user controls**: for anyone who wants to nerd out and dive under the hood to see what this thing is **really** able to do. Easily acceded via browser, aor ndroid/iOS apps.
- **Easy to configue**

## üìö Documentation

- **[Listener Applet](docs/Listener.md)**: Establishes a connection with the Medrunner API to fetch real-time events and broadcasts them for downstream processing.
- **[Emitter Applet](docs/Emitter.md)**: Acts on received events by triggering specific WLED actions.
- **[Parent App](docs/ParentApp.md)**: Serves as the control hub, managing the Listener and Emitter applets while exposing a REST API for configuration.
- **[Event Handlers Module](docs/EventHandlers.md)**: Implements logic to process and respond to events like `EmergencyCreate`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Usage

### Installation Steps
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DoctorKarma111/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure your environment**:
   - Create a `.env` file and add your API token:
     ```env
     API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here
     ```
   - Update `config.json` in the shared folder for WLED settings:
     ```json
     {
         "wledIP": "192.168.1.100",
         "defaultEmergencyPreset": 1
     }
     ```

### Running the Application
Launch the Parent App to initialize the system:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## üåü Components Overview

### Listener Applet

The Listener Applet establishes a persistent WebSocket connection with the Medrunner API, enabling real-time event monitoring. It emits structured events for other applets to process, such as:

- **EmergencyCreate**: Indicates a new emergency has been created.
- **PersonUpdate**: Provides updates on personnel status.

Key Features:
- Robust retry logic ensures consistent connectivity.
- EventEmitter integration allows seamless communication with other applets.

For detailed documentation, visit the [Listener Applet Documentation](docs/Listener.md).

### Emitter Applet

The Emitter Applet is responsible for taking action on events received from the Listener Applet. It communicates with WLED devices to trigger dynamic lighting effects such as preset changes or custom color displays.

Key Features:
- Processes events like `EmergencyCreate` to trigger lighting actions.
- Uses HTTP requests to interact with WLED devices.
- Dynamically configurable for presets and actions.

For detailed documentation, visit the [Emitter Applet Documentation](docs/Emitter.md).

### Parent App

The Parent App acts as the central control hub, managing the Listener and Emitter applets while exposing REST API endpoints for monitoring and configuration. This app serves as the backbone of the system, ensuring all components work cohesively.

Key Features:
- Provides `/api` endpoints for status and settings.
- Dynamically reloads configuration from `config.json`.
- Handles critical processes like applet restart upon failure.

For detailed documentation, visit the [Parent App Documentation](docs/ParentApp.md).

### Event Handlers Module

The Event Handlers Module provides the logic to process and respond to specific events received from the Listener. It integrates directly with the Emitter to trigger actions on WLED devices. 

Key Example: **Handling EmergencyCreate Events**

When an `EmergencyCreate` event is emitted, this module processes the payload, retrieves the relevant configuration, and sends an HTTP request to the WLED device to activate the designated preset.

**Implementation:**
```javascript
const axios = require("axios");

async function handleEmergencyCreate(emergency, config) {
    console.log("EmergencyCreate event received:", emergency);

    const presetId = config.defaultEmergencyPreset || 1;
    const wledIP = config.wledIP || "WLED_IP_HERE";

    try {
        await axios.get(`http://${wledIP}/&P1=${presetId}`);
        console.log(`WLED preset ${presetId} triggered successfully for IP ${wledIP}.`);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Failed to trigger WLED preset:", error.message);
    }
}
```

For detailed documentation, visit the [Event Handlers Module Documentation](docs/EventHandlers.md).
